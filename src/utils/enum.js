// These comments help clarify the purpose of the code, which is to define the roles and their corresponding values in the role object.

// Enum representing user roles
export const Role = {
  Admin: 1,     // Admin role has a value of 1
  Seller: 2,    // Seller role has a value of 2
  Buyer: 3,     // Buyer role has a value of 3
};
